# Session Log: 20250918-S2

*   **User:** Bachir
*   **Instance:** LCL
*   **Goal:** Recovering the lost git repository, backing up the current environment, and preparing for the creation of moodle4.5 and moodle5.0 projects.

## Summary of Actions:
*   Attempted to recover the lost Git repository by cloning from GitHub, but encountered persistent SSH key issues.
*   Generated a new SSH key pair (`id_rsa_moodle_dev`) for the local machine.
*   Troubleshooted SSH agent and host key verification problems.
*   User manually deleted contents of `D:\moodle-dev` and restored essential files/folders from backup.
*   Verified that `D:\moodle-dev` now contains the expected Moodle 4.5 environment files and `docker-compose.yml` is configured for named volumes.
*   Confirmed access to session logs.
*   **Verifying Local Environment Cleanliness:**
    *   Compared file count and total size of `D:\moodle-dev\moodle` (29003 files, 308692240 bytes) with `moodle-code` volume in container (29004 files, 308692957 bytes).
    *   Identified a discrepancy of 1 file and 717 bytes.
    *   **Found Discrepancy:** Identified `config.php` as the extra file in the container's Moodle installation (`/var/www/html/config.php`), accounting for the 1-file and 717-byte difference.
    *   **Action on Discrepancy:** Copied `config.php` from the container to `D:\moodle-dev\moodle\config-lcl-bkup.php` for backup and reference.



## Next Steps:
*   Create proper rules for the .gitignore file.
*   Continue later.
