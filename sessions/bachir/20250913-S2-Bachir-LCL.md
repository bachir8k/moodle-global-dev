## Goal: Fix the git and other issues prevented a successful deployment on the VPS environment.
## Summary of Actions:
1.  **Session Kick-off:**
    *   Created a new session log for this deployment.
    *   Authored a comprehensive guide for data and database migration and added it to `documentation/operations.md`.
2.  **Git Repository Cleanup:**
    *   Reset the Git staging area to clear incorrectly staged files.
    *   Updated the `.gitignore` file to exclude local project files, documentation, and correctly ignore the main `moodle/config.php`.
    *   Removed the `documentation/` folder from the Git index.
    *   Staged the entire `moodle/` directory, ensuring all necessary source code is included.
    *   Committed the complete and corrected Moodle source code to the repository.
3.  **Deployment:**
    *   Pushed the new commit to the remote GitHub repository, making it available for the VPS.

## Next Steps:
*   The user will switch to the VPS environment.
*   The user will instruct the VPS-AI to pull the latest changes from the git repository.
*   The user will instruct the VPS-AI to re-run the deployment script.

## Next Instructions (From AI to AI):
*   Prompt 1: "The local AI has fixed the git repository. Please pull the latest changes from the `origin/master` branch to get the complete Moodle source code."
*   Prompt 2: "Now that you have the complete source code, please execute the `deploy.sh` script to attempt a fresh installation of Moodle."
*   Prompt 3: "After the script completes, please validate the installation by checking if you can access the Moodle site and if there are any errors in the logs."
