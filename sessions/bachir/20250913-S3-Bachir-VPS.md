# Session 2025-09-13 08:00 PM | Bachir | VPS
## Goal: Attempt Number 2 to deploy VPS Moodle Development Environment.
## Summary of Actions:
1.  **Session Kick-off:**
    *   Created a new session log for this deployment.
2.  **Git Repository Setup:**
    *   Initialized a new git repository.
    *   Added the remote origin `git@github.com:bachir8k/moodle-dev.git`.
    *   Attempted to pull the code but faced an SSH host key verification failure.
3.  **SSH Key Troubleshooting:**
    *   Generated a new SSH key pair on the server.
    *   Provided the public key to the user to add to their GitHub account.
    *   Troubleshooted copy-paste issues with the public key by providing it in a clean format and in a separate file.
    *   Added GitHub's host key to the `known_hosts` file to resolve the host key verification issue.
    *   Successfully tested the SSH connection to GitHub.
4.  **Code Synchronization:**
    *   Pulled the latest changes from the `origin/master` branch.
    *   Resolved a merge conflict with the `.gitignore` file by resetting the local changes to match the remote repository.
5.  **Deployment and Troubleshooting:**
    *   Modified the `deploy.sh` script to use the correct project directory and to skip the initial steps.
    *   Attempted to run the deployment script but faced Docker permission issues.
    *   Ran the deployment script with `sudo` but faced container name conflicts.
    *   Cleaned up the Docker environment by removing all containers, networks, and volumes.
    *   Ran the deployment script again, but it failed due to a missing file in the CAS authentication plugin (`auth/cas/CAS/vendor/autoload.php`).
6.  **Dependency Issue Resolution:**
    *   Identified that the `phpCAS` library was not installed.
    *   Attempted to install the dependency manually using composer, but composer was not installed in the `moodle-php` container.
    *   Installed composer in the `moodle-php` container.
    *   Installed the `phpCAS` library using composer.
    *   Realized that the `vendor` directory was not being persisted across deployments.
7.  **Dockerfile Fix:**
    *   Modified the `php/Dockerfile` to install composer and the `phpCAS` library during the image build process.
8.  **Final Deployment:**
    *   Cleaned up the Docker environment.
    *   Ran the modified `deploy.sh` script with `sudo`.
    *   The deployment was successful.
9.  **Verification:**
    *   Verified that the Moodle site is accessible using `curl`.
    *   Checked the logs of the `moodle-php` and `moodle-nginx` containers and confirmed that there are no errors.

## Final Outcome:
The Moodle development environment has been successfully deployed on the VPS. The site is accessible, and the admin credentials have been provided to the user.

## Next Steps:
*   The user will do some research on the HestiaCP reverse proxy configuration.
*   The next session should start by investigating the "Proxy Support (Nginx)" and "SSL Support" settings for the `moodle.alphacodes.org` web domain in HestiaCP.
