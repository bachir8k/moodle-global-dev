## Goal: Build and test a workflow to sync content between different Moodle environments.
## Summary of Actions:
1.  Discussed different synchronization scenarios for code (themes/plugins) and content (courses, users).
2.  Agreed to use Git for code and a Moodle backup/restore script for content.
3.  Identified user and enrolment synchronization as the most complex part.
4.  User decided to postpone the sync script development to first observe real-world usage patterns.
## Next Steps:
*   The user will perform development tasks on the local environment.
*   We will monitor the types of assets (themes, plugins, courses) that are frequently pushed to the VPS.
*   Revisit the sync script development after gathering more data on usage patterns.
