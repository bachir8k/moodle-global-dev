# Session 2025-09-15 07:00 PM | Bachir | LCL
## Goal: Continue development of the Moodle project.
## Summary of Actions:
- Renamed the session log file to `session-2025-09-15-Bachir-LCL-AI.md` to match the project's naming convention.
- Updated the `documentation/readme.md` file to include a more explicit "AI Session Start-up Protocol" to ensure future AI instances have a clear set of instructions to follow at the beginning of each session. This includes instructions on naming session files and reviewing all documentation and past sessions.
- Investigated a persistent admin login issue.
- Reset the admin password multiple times with no success.
- Verified the user's status in the database, checked `config.php`, and inspected logs, finding no clear errors.
- Purged Moodle caches, which did not resolve the issue.
- Based on user feedback, identified the previous switch to bind mounts as a potential source of instability.
- Reverted the environment to the high-performance named volume configuration as documented in `installation.md`.
- Backed up and removed developer tools (`tasks.php`, `tasks.json`) that were created during the bind-mount phase.
- Performed a full, destructive re-installation of the Moodle environment by running `docker-compose down -v`, `build`, and `up`.
- Troubleshot the installation, which failed due to a pre-existing local `config.php` that was copied into the new image.
- Backed up and deleted the local `config.php` and repeated the installation process.
- Corrected the `install.php` command after it failed due to an invalid flag.
- Finalized the installation by setting `moodledata` permissions and adding the `reverseproxy` setting to the new `config.php`.
- Resolved a final "Permission Denied" error by correcting the ownership of the `config.php` file after it was modified.
- Confirmed the Moodle site is now accessible and the admin login is working.
- Discussed and designed a "restoration checkpoint" strategy to prevent future data loss.
- The strategy involves creating timestamped backups of critical configuration files, the PostgreSQL database, and the `moodledata` directory.
- Created a new `backups-lcl/configs/` directory structure to store these backups.
- Created a comprehensive shell script at `documentation/scripts/create-checkpoint.sh` to automate the full checkpoint process.
- Moved the `create-checkpoint.sh` script to the project root to be included in Git.
- Added the `backups-lcl/` directory to `.gitignore`.
- Created a `restore-from-checkpoint.sh` script in the project root.
- The restore script features an interactive menu to select from available checkpoints and a final confirmation prompt to prevent accidental data loss.
- Updated the `create-checkpoint.sh` script to include a retention policy, automatically keeping only the 3 most recent database and `moodledata` backups.
- Updated the `documentation/readme.md` to formalize the rule that critical configuration files must be backed up to the `backups-lcl/configs` directory before modification.
- Reviewed and refactored the `readme.md` file to improve clarity for future AI sessions. This included:
    - Adding a new "Environment Configurations" section to explain the Local (Bind Mount) vs. VPS (Named Volume) trade-off.
    - Consolidating the checkpoint and backup rules into a single, clearer guideline.
    - Adding a critical warning about the `moodle/config.php` file causing installation failures.
    - Adding a note about script execution on Windows.
- Refined the "AI Session Start-up Protocol" in `readme.md` to require the AI to explicitly ask for its name and the current environment at the start of each session, making the context-setting process more robust.
- Established and documented two primary rules for the upcoming theme development work:
    1.  All assets (CSS, JS, fonts) must be localized and self-contained.
    2.  All custom identifiers (HTML IDs, CSS classes, JS functions) must be namespaced with the prefix `ncsa2026-` to avoid conflicts with Moodle core or other themes like `ncsa2025` and `remui`.
- Added these rules to a new "Theme Development Guidelines" section in `documentation/readme.md`.
