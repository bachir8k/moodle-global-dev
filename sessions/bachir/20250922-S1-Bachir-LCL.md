## Summary of Actions
*   User requested to stop ### Phase 3: Moodle 4.5 Verification Environment and will provide a new phase with new tasks.
*   User has provided a new phase and steps ### Phase 4: Fix the current installed Environment.
*   Deleted the `D:\moodle-dev\moodle4.5-verify` directory.
*   Updated `D:\moodle-dev\moodle4.5\docker-compose.yml` to prefix all container and volume names with `moodle4.5-`.
*   Backed up the live `config.php` from the `moodle-php` container to the local filesystem.
*   Manually executed the `create-checkpoint.sh` script steps to create a backup of the database and `moodledata` volumes.
*   Investigated `.sh` script execution on Windows and found `bash.exe` at `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`. Plan to test execution with the full path after the environment is restored.
*   Stopped and removed the old Docker containers and volumes.
*   Rebuilt the environment with the new `moodle4.5-` prefixed names.
*   Updated the `create-checkpoint.sh` and `restore-from-checkpoint.sh` scripts to use the new `moodle4.5-` prefixed service names and credentials.
*   Fixed the `nginx/default.conf` file to point to the correct `moodle4.5-php` service.
*   Manually modified `moodle-db-backup.2025-09-22_20-25-54.sql` to replace `OWNER TO moodle;` with `OWNER TO moodle45;`.
*   Decided to perform a full Docker environment cleanup due to persistent volume issues.
*   Manually deleted Docker volumes via Docker Desktop.
*   Performed a full Docker environment cleanup (stopped all containers, removed all containers, removed all volumes, and rebuilt the environment).
*   Manually restored the database and `moodledata` from the checkpoint.
*   Updated `config.php` with new database credentials and copied it to the container. Restarted `moodle4.5-php` container.
*   User has verified the installation and confirms that Moodle is running smoothly.
*   Renamed the local `config.php` to `config-live-bkup.php`.
*   Completed Phase 4.

## New Founded Issues
*   #### Issue: Nginx container fails to start after environment rebuild.
    *   **Date:** 2025-09-22
    *   **Found by:** bachir-AI
    *   **Environment:** LCL-Windows
    *   **Status:** Resolved
    *   **Symptoms:** The `moodle4.5-nginx` container exits unexpectedly after `docker-compose up`.
    *   **Diagnosis & Troubleshooting:** Logs show `nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream "moodle-php"`. The `nginx/default.conf` file was not updated with the new `moodle4.5-php` service name.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated `nginx/default.conf` to point to the `moodle4.5-php` service. Recreated the `moodle4.5-nginx` container to apply the fix.
*   #### Issue: Persistent "relation already exists" errors during database restore.
    *   **Date:** 2025-09-22
    *   **Found by:** bachir-AI
    *   **Environment:** LCL-Windows
    *   **Status:** Unresolved
    *   **Symptoms:** After dropping and creating the database, restoring from the SQL backup file consistently results in `ERROR: relation "mdl_..." already exists`. This occurs even after attempting a full Docker environment cleanup (stopping/removing all containers, removing all volumes, rebuilding environment).
    *   **Diagnosis & Troubleshooting:** The `DROP DATABASE` command appears insufficient to fully clear the database, leading to conflicts with `CREATE TABLE` commands in the backup. This suggests the issue might be within the SQL backup file itself (e.g., containing duplicate `CREATE TABLE` statements or other inconsistencies), or a deeper interaction with PostgreSQL's restore process that is not resolved by a simple database drop/create.
*   #### Issue: Docker volume management is unreliable on Windows.
    *   **Date:** 2025-09-22
    *   **Found by:** bachir-AI
    *   **Environment:** LCL-Windows
    *   **Status:** Unresolved
    *   **Symptoms:** `docker volume prune` and `docker volume rm` commands do not reliably remove volumes, even when containers are stopped. Volumes remain visible in Docker Desktop.
    *   **Diagnosis & Troubleshooting:** Docker daemon seems to hold onto volumes, preventing their removal. Requires manual verification with `docker volume ls` after any volume operation.
