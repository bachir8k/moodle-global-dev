## Goal: Complete the implementation for VPS Moodle Environment.
## Summary of Actions:
1.  **Validation of the previous installation:**
    *   Checked the status of the docker containers. All were running.
    *   Checked the logs of `moodle-php` and `moodle-nginx` containers. No obvious errors were found.
    *   Used `curl` to access the Moodle site and got a fatal error: `Class "core_cache\config" not found`.
2.  **Troubleshooting the installation:**
    *   Attempted to purge the Moodle cache, but it failed with the same error.
    *   Discovered that the file `cache/classes/config.php` was missing.
    *   Recommended to restart the installation from scratch.
3.  **Fresh installation attempt:**
    *   Documented the issue in `documentation/issues.md`.
    *   Cleaned up the old environment by running `docker compose down --volumes`.
    *   Ran the `deploy.sh` script to perform a fresh installation.
4.  **Troubleshooting the fresh installation:**
    *   The installation failed with the error `Unrecognised options: -vvv`.
    *   Modified the `deploy.sh` script to remove the `-vvv` option.
    *   The installation failed again with the error `Default theme boost not available or broken!`.
    *   The user uploaded the `theme/boost` directory from their local copy.
    *   The installation failed again with the error `The configuration file config.php already exists`.
    *   Removed the `config.php` file.
    *   The installation failed again with the error `Failed opening required '[dirroot]/lib/htmlpurifier/HTMLPurifier/Config.php'`.
5.  **Documented the issues:**
    *   Documented the issue with the missing `cache/classes/config.php` file in `documentation/issues.md`.
    *   Documented the issue with the incomplete git repository in `documentation/issues.md`.

6.  **Fixes applied to `deploy.sh`:**
    *   Removed the `-vvv` option from the `php admin/cli/install.php` command as it was not a recognized option.
    *   Temporarily replaced the installation command with a help command (`--help`) to debug the installation issue.

## Next Steps:
*   The user will work with the local Gemini CLI to check all files and make sure they are committed properly to git.
*   Once done, the user will work with the VPS Gemini CLI to attempt implementing again the VPS Moodle Development Environment.

## Next Instructions (From AI to AI)
*   Prompt 1: "The user has committed a new version of the Moodle source code to the git repository. Please check with the user and validate that all files are committed properly"
