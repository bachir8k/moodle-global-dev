## Goal: Develop a web-based tool for managing development tasks.
## Summary of Actions:
1.  Created a new tool for managing tasks, accessible at `/dev_tools/tasks.php`.
2.  The tool features a PHP backend and a jQuery/Bootstrap frontend.
3.  It supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a `tasks.json` data file.
4.  Integrated the DataTables.net library for advanced sorting, searching, and pagination.
5.  Troubleshot and resolved a major environment issue where new files were not visible in the containers due to the use of named volumes instead of bind mounts. The fix involved updating `docker-compose.yml` and documenting the issue in `issues.md`.
6.  Added several UI and data enhancements based on user feedback.
7.  Engaged in a planning discussion for converting the tool into a full Moodle plugin and advised that theme development should be the next priority.

## Next Steps:
*   The user will ask final clarification questions for this session.
*   The next session will focus on planning and developing a new Moodle theme.
