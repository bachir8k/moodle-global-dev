# Session Log: 2025-09-16 S1

*   **User:** Bachir
*   **Instance:** LCL
*   **Goal:** Fix the project folders structure and continue with the UI design.

## Summary of Actions:
1.  **Session Start-up:**
    *   Followed the AI Session Start-up Protocol.
    *   Read all documentation files.
    *   Identified that session logs were being ignored by git and read them by disabling gitignore handling.
    *   Created a new session log file.
2.  **README Update:**
    *   Updated the `documentation/README.md` file to instruct the AI to ignore `.gitignore` when reading documentation files.
    *   Updated the `documentation/README.md` file with the UI Design Workflow.
3.  **Web Server:**
    *   Started a Python web server on `localhost:8000` to serve files from the `ui/generated` directory using the command: `start /b python -m http.server 8000 --directory ui/generated`.
4.  **UI Backup Workflow:**
    *   Created a Python script `ui/manage_ui_backup.py` to create and restore backups of the `ui/generated` directory.
    *   The script supports creating compressed `.tar.gz` backups, limiting the number of backups to 10, and both interactive and non-interactive restores.
    *   Performed a successful test of the script:
        1.  Created a backup.
        2.  Modified `ui/generated/login.html`.
        3.  Restored the backup.
        4.  Verified that the file was restored to its original state.
5.  **Login Page Refactoring:**
    *   Refactored the UI design from `ui/original/test.html` into the live `ui/generated/login.html` file.
    *   Created a pre-work backup using the `manage_ui_backup.py` script.
    *   Separated the CSS into a new `ui/generated/css/login.css` file.
    *   Separated the JavaScript for the password-toggle into `ui/generated/js/main.js`.
    *   Removed the obsolete `ui/generated/css/style.css` file.
    *   **Naming Convention Fix:** After user review, updated the HTML and CSS to prefix all custom classes with `ncsa2026-` to adhere to project guidelines.
    *   **CSS Bug Fix:** Corrected a positioning issue with the password-toggle icon by restructuring the surrounding HTML.
    *   Created a final backup of the `ui/generated` directory after the work was completed and approved.
6.  **Final UI Enhancements & Arabic Version:**
    *   **Font Correction:** Corrected the CSS to use the project's `NeoSansArabic` font instead of the externally linked `Noto Sans Arabic`.
    *   **SVG Logo:** Modified the `logo_academy_v.svg` file's `viewBox` to remove excess padding, with manual user guidance.
    *   **CSS Fine-Tuning:** Performed several iterative adjustments to margins and link hover styles based on user feedback to perfect the layout and design.
    *   **Arabic Page Creation:** Created `login_ar.html` by copying the English version.
    *   **RTL Implementation:** Updated `login_ar.html` to support RTL by setting the `dir="rtl"` attribute, linking the Bootstrap RTL stylesheet, and adding an override stylesheet (`login_ar.css`) for RTL-specific fixes.
    *   **Translation:** Populated `login_ar.html` with the full set of Arabic translations extracted from the live site, correcting for tool errors that caused initial replacements to fail.
    *   **RTL Bug Fixes:** Corrected text alignment in form fields for the RTL version.
7.  **Session End:**
    *   Created multiple backups throughout the enhancement process.
    *   The user will now generate new HTML screens using an external tool. The next session will focus on integrating these new screens.
