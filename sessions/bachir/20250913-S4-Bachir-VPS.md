## Goal: Complete the VPS Moodle Environment Implementation
## Summary of Actions:
1.  **HestiaCP Reverse Proxy Issue Resolution:**
    *   The user provided the solution for the HestiaCP reverse proxy configuration issue.
    *   Updated `documentation/issues.md` with the resolution, marking the issue as "Resolved".
    *   The solution involved correctly configuring `moodle.tpl` and `moodle.stpl` templates in HestiaCP with the appropriate `proxy_pass` and location block settings.
2.  **Moodle `config.php` Permission Issue:**
    *   The user reported a "Permission denied" error when Moodle tried to access `config.php`.
    *   This indicates that the `www-data` user (which the web server runs as) does not have the necessary permissions to read `config.php`.
    *   Executed `sudo docker compose exec moodle-php chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/config.php` to change the ownership of `config.php` inside the `moodle-php` container. This command executed successfully.

## Final Outcome:
The Moodle development environment on the VPS is fully functional, and the admin password has been successfully reset.

## Next Steps:
*   Prepare and test a new script or guide on how to Sync/Migration content between different environments. 

## Next Instructions (From AI to AI)
*   The user has completed the VPS Moodle environment implementation and will continue work on the local environment.
