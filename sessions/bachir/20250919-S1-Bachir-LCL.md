## Project Plan | Scope of Work

### Phase 1: Restructure the project and establish the Moodle 4.5 baseline
1.  `[Done]` **Create the `moodle4.5` folder** at the root of the project.
2.  `[Done]` **Move the existing Moodle 4.5 files and folders** (`moodle`, `moodledata`, `nginx`, `php`, `documentation`, `backups-lcl`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.gitignore`, `.aiexclude`) into the new `moodle4.5` folder.
3.  `[Done]` **Initialize a new Git repository** inside the `moodle4.5` folder.
4.  `[Done]` **Create a new, empty repository on GitHub** named `moodle4.5-dev`.
5.  `[Done]` **Add the remote repository** to the local git configuration.
6.  `[Done]` **Fix the `.gitignore` file** by removing the `documentation/` entry.
7.  `[Done]` **Create a `git-45.sh` file** in the `moodle4.5/documentation/scripts` directory for the VPS.
8.  `[Done]` **Create a `git-45.bat` file** in the root directory to simplify git commands.
9.  `[Done]` **Commit all the files** in the `moodle4.5` folder as the initial commit.
    *   `[Done]` Address line ending (LF/CRLF) warnings by configuring `core.autocrlf`.
    *   `[Done]` Add all files to the staging area.
    *   `[Done]` Guide user through manual commit and verify.
10. `[Done]` **Push this initial commit** to the new `moodle4.5-dev` repository.
11. `[Done]` **Update documentation files** (e.g., `installation.md`, `configuration.md`) to reflect the new folder structure.
    *   `[Done]` Update `installation.md`.
    *   `[Done]` Update `configuration.md`.
    *   `[Done]` Update `operations.md`.

### Phase 2: Moodle 4.5 Verification Environment
1.  `[Next]` **Update Session Log:** I will update the session log to reflect this new verification phase.
2.  **Create Temporary Verification Directory:** I will create a new temporary directory, for example, `D:\moodle-dev\moodle4.5-verify`.
3.  **Create Verification `docker-compose.yml`:** I will create a `docker-compose.yml` file inside `moodle4.5-verify`. This file will:
    *   Reference the Moodle 4.5 files in `D:\moodle-dev\moodle4.5`.
    *   Use unique container names (e.g., `moodle45-verify-php`, `moodle45-verify-nginx`, `moodle45-verify-db`).
    *   Map to `localhost:9001` for Nginx.
4.  **Build and Install Moodle 4.5:**
    *   I will navigate to `moodle4.5-verify`.
    *   Run `docker-compose build`.
    *   Run `docker-compose up -d`.
    *   Execute the Moodle CLI installer.
    *   Fix permissions and update `config.php` as needed.
5.  **Verify Installation:** I will confirm that Moodle is accessible and functional at `localhost:9001`.
6.  **Decision:** Once verified, we will decide whether to keep this `localhost:9001` environment as the primary Moodle 4.5 setup or tear it down before proceeding with Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Set up the new Moodle 5.0 environment
1.  **Create the `moodle5.0` folder** at the root of the project.
2.  **Download Moodle 5.0** into the `moodle5.0` folder.
3.  **Create a new Docker environment** for Moodle 5.0, ensuring the `docker-compose.yml` uses a different port (e.g., 9100) and different container names to avoid conflicts with the 4.5 environment.
4.  **Initialize a new Git repository** inside the `moodle5.0` folder.
5.  **Create a new, empty repository on GitHub** named `moodle5.0-dev`.
6.  **Add the remote repository** to the local git configuration.
7.  **Create a `git-50.sh` file** in the `moodle5.0/documentation/scripts` directory for the VPS.
8.  **Create a `git-50.bat` file** in the root directory to simplify git commands.
9.  **Commit and push** the initial Moodle 5.0 project.

### Phase 4: Migration Script Development
1.  **Update `_global/README.md`** and any other relevant documentation to include instructions on the new Git workflow,. specifying that all Git commands must either use the `.bat` files or be run from the correct sub-directory.
2.  Once both environments are set up and running, we can then begin the work on the migration scripts as you planned.
