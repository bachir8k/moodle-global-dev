# Session Log: 2025-09-19 S2

*   **User:** Bachir
*   **Instance:** LCL
*   **Goal:** Optimize the project structure, enhance the AI Agent Workflow, and get ready to resume work.

## Summary of Actions:

### Protocol Refactoring

- **Analyzed Existing Protocols:** Extracted all protocols from the `README.md` and organized them into a structured table for review.
- **Defined New Structure:** Based on user feedback, designed a more modular documentation structure consisting of a new `general-ai-protocols.md` file and the existing role-specific files (`vpm.md`, `devop.md`, `sme.md`).
- **Distributed Protocols:** Created the new general protocol file and updated the role-specific files, populating them with the refactored and re-assigned protocols. The original `README.md` was intentionally left untouched for now to serve as a backup during the transition.
- **Incorporated New Rules:** Added new protocols based on user suggestions, including a VPM reminder system and a DevOp process for documenting new issues.
- **Handled Protocol Conflict:** To prevent context conflicts during the transition, a temporary directive was added to the `README.md` instructing the AI to ignore the new protocol files until the refactoring is complete.

### Workflow and Structure Finalization

- **Workflow Simplification:** Finalized a simplified, script-based workflow for managing the `global` repository, abandoning a formal Pull Request process in favor of automation and convention.
- **Issue & Suggestion Handling:** Redefined the process for handling issues and suggestions. They will now be embedded within individual session logs for later parsing and consolidation into the master `issues.md` file, which is now a curated document.
- **Folder Naming:** Decided to use team member names for the session folders (e.g., `bachir`) for simplicity, after confirming that I cannot automatically retrieve user account names.
- **Directory Restructuring:**
    - Created the `global/sessions/bachir/` directory.
    - Moved all of Bachir's existing session logs into the new subdirectory.
- **Documentation Update:** Updated the `global/README.md` to reflect the fully-defined workflow, including the new session folder structure, the process for embedded issues/suggestions, and the updated AI start-up protocol.
- **Deferred Tasks:** The development of the automated sync script has been explicitly put on hold until the manual workflow is proven.

## Next Steps:

-   The user will take a break and review the new protocol files.
-   When ready, the user will provide feedback or approve the changes to finalize the protocol refactoring.
-   **Investigate and resolve the intermittent "communication snag" / API errors.**
-   **Review and optimize the main `gemini.md` memory file.**
