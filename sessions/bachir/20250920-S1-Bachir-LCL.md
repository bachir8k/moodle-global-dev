## Summary of Actions

*   **Protocol Refinement & Consolidation:**
    *   Renamed `general-ai-protocols.md` to `ai-protocols.md`.
    *   Consolidated all role-specific protocols (`devop.md`, `vpm.md`, `sme.md`) and instructions from `README-BKUP.md` into the single `ai-protocols.md` file.
    *   Agreed to deprecate and delete the `/roles` directory.

*   **Protocol Restructuring & Rephrasing:**
    *   Restructured all protocols to use the consistent `Objective/Action/Implementation` format.
    *   Re-numbered the entire `ai-protocols.md` document into a hierarchical structure (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1).
    *   Rephrased the entire document for a more direct, AI-centric tone.

*   **Specific Protocol Enhancements:**
    *   **Session Start-up:** Inlined the full start-up procedure and added a step to read project-specific `README.md` files.
    *   **Task Management:** Clarified the distinct purposes of `Current Activity` (for ad-hoc tasks) and `Next Steps` (for future reminders), and refined the task lifecycle instructions.
    *   **Git Workflow:** Flagged the protocol as CRITICAL and made the instructions more robust to handle projects without specific wrapper scripts.
    *   **Token Management:** Added instructions for handling verbose commands and for using `ai-message.md` for long, formatted outputs.
    *   **Issue Documentation:** Enhanced the format to include `Found by` and `Environment` fields.
    *   **Checkpoints:** Made the protocol generic, pointing to project-specific READMEs for details and including information about retention policies.
    *   **UI Backup Workflow:** Added the backup policy (when to back up) to the existing protocol.
    *   **Project Plan & Reminders:** Added protocols to ensure the Project Plan and pending reminders are carried over between sessions, and that reminders are announced at the start of a new session.
    *   **Ad-hoc Sub-task Tracking:** Added a new protocol to track the status of nested sub-tasks within the `## Current Activity` section for improved resilience.
    *   **Workflow Optimization:** Added the `[fast]` and `[aim]` command protocols to accelerate simple tasks and message formatting.
    *   **Time Tracking:** Added a new protocol to automatically track and cumulate session time.

*   **Documentation Hierarchy Refinement:**
    *   Cleaned project-specific links from `global/README.md`.
    *   Created a new `moodle4.5/README.md` and populated it with project-specific information on version control and checkpoint scripts.
    *   Updated the global `README.md` to definitively point to `ai-protocols.md` as the single source of truth for all workflows.
    *   Created a new `README.md` file at the project root to hold high-level workspace information.
    *   Updated the `ai-protocols.md` to include reading the new root `README.md` during the start-up sequence.
    *   Moved the `Git Workflow for Multiple Repositories` section from `global/README.md` to the root `README.md`.

*   **Workflow Definition:**
    *   Formally established that creating session logs is a task to be performed strictly by the AI.
    *   Corrected my own failure to follow the logging protocol by retrospectively documenting all actions from this session.
    *   Clarified the distinction between `Core Knowledge` and `Project Memory` and saved the terminology to the Project Memory.

*   **Folder Structure Refinement (Ad-hoc):**
    *   Renamed the `01-global` directory to `global`.
    *   Searched for and updated all internal file references to the new `global` path.
    *   Deleted the `README-BKUP.md` file from the `global` folder.

*   **Project Plan Restructuring:**
    *   Elevated the ad-hoc task for setting up Git repositories into a formal phase in the Project Plan.

## Project Plan | Scope of Work

### Phase 1: Restructure the project and establish the Moodle 4.5 baseline
1.  `[Done]` **Create the `moodle4.5` folder** at the root of the project.
2.  `[Done]` **Move the existing Moodle 4.5 files and folders** into the new `moodle4.5` folder.
3.  `[Done]` **Initialize a new Git repository** inside the `moodle4.5` folder.
4.  `[Done]` **Create a new, empty repository on GitHub** named `moodle4.5-dev`.
5.  `[Done]` **Add the remote repository** to the local git configuration.
6.  `[Done]` **Fix the `.gitignore` file** by removing the `documentation/` entry.
7.  `[Done]` **Create a `git-45.sh` file** in the `moodle4.5/documentation/scripts` directory for the VPS.
8.  `[Done]` **Create a `git-45.bat` file** in the root directory to simplify git commands.
9.  `[Done]` **Commit all the files** in the `moodle4.5` folder as the initial commit.
10. `[Done]` **Push this initial commit** to the new `moodle4.5-dev` repository.
11. `[Done]` **Update documentation files** to reflect the new folder structure.

### Phase 2: Ad-hoc SOW 1: Fix the Git Repository Setup
1.  `[Paused]` **Initialize Repository:** Initialize a new Git repository directly inside the `global` folder.
2.  **Create `.gitignore`:** Create a `.gitignore` file inside `global/`.
3.  **Create Remote Repository:** User to create a new, empty repository on GitHub (e.g., `moodle-global-dev`).
4.  **Add Remote:** Add the new GitHub repository as the `origin` remote.
5.  **Create Wrapper Script:** Create a `git-global.bat` file in the project root.
6.  **Commit & Push:** Add all files, create an initial commit, and push to the new remote repository.

### Phase 3: Moodle 4.5 Verification Environment
1.  **Create Temporary Verification Directory:** Create a new temporary directory, for example, `D:\moodle-dev\moodle4.5-verify`.
2.  **Create Verification `docker-compose.yml`:** Create a `docker-compose.yml` file inside `moodle4.5-verify`.
3.  **Build and Install Moodle 4.5:** Build and run the containers, then execute the Moodle CLI installer.
4.  **Verify Installation:** Confirm that Moodle is accessible and functional at `localhost:9001`.
5.  **Decision:** Decide whether to keep this environment or tear it down.

### Phase 4: Set up the new Moodle 5.0 environment
1.  **Create the `moodle5.0` folder**.
2.  **Download Moodle 5.0**.
3.  **Create a new Docker environment** for Moodle 5.0.
4.  **Initialize a new Git repository** inside `moodle5.0`.
5.  **Create a new repository on GitHub** named `moodle5.0-dev`.
6.  **Add the remote repository**.
7.  **Create a `git-50.bat` wrapper script**.
8.  **Commit and push** the initial Moodle 5.0 project.

### Phase 5: Migration Script Development
1.  **Update Documentation:** Update all relevant documentation with the new Git workflow.
2.  **Develop Migration Scripts:** Begin work on migration scripts.

## Current Activity
