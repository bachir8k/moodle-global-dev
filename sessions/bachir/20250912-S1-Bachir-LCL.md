## Goal: Start preparing the local Moodle development environment to install, troubleshoot and optimize, then prepare for VPS deployment.
## Summary of Actions:
1.  **Initial Diagnosis:** Identified that the initial "slowness" was caused by an incomplete Moodle installation, leading to database errors.
2.  **First Installation (Bind Mount):** Successfully installed Moodle in the initial environment by:
    *   Creating and configuring `config.php`.
    *   Running the Moodle CLI installer.
    *   Troubleshooting and fixing database connection errors, file permission errors, and a reverse-proxy redirect loop (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`).
3.  **Performance Investigation:** After a successful install, diagnosed the remaining sluggishness. Ran comparative benchmarks that proved the database connection was fast, and the performance bottleneck was the filesystem I/O overhead from using Docker bind mounts on Windows.
4.  **Migration to Named Volumes:** To solve the performance bottleneck, migrated the entire environment to a high-performance named-volume setup.
    *   Modified `php/Dockerfile` to copy the Moodle source code directly into the image.
    *   Modified `docker-compose.yml` to use named volumes (`moodle-code`, `moodledata`) instead of bind mounts.
    *   Rebuilt the Docker image and successfully re-installed Moodle in the new, high-performance environment.
5.  **Git & Deployment Preparation:**
    *   Initialized a local Git repository.
    *   Created a `.gitignore` file tailored for Moodle.
    *   Pushed the entire project to a new remote repository on GitHub.
    *   Authored a comprehensive deployment script (`deploy.sh`) for the target VPS (Ubuntu 24.04).
    *   Updated project documentation (`installation.md`, `configuration.md`) to reflect the new setup.
    *   Created `next_instructions_todo.md` to bootstrap future sessions.
    *   Organized all scripts and notes into the `documentation` folder.

## Next Steps:
*   The user will manually install the Gemini CLI on the VPS.
*   The user will upload the `documentation` folder (containing `deploy.sh` and `next_instructions_todo.md`) to the VPS.
*   The user will start a new Gemini CLI session on the VPS and ask the new instance to start byhhhhhhhhhh the `next_instructions_todo.md` file to guide the new instance in deploying the project.

## Next Instructions (From AI to AI)
*   Prompt 1: Understand the Project - "Hello. Please read all the markdown files in the `documentation` directory to familiarize yourself with the project goals and the new, high-performance installation setup."
*   Prompt 2: Review the Deployment Plan - "I have created a deployment script named `deploy.sh`. Please read this script to understand the deployment steps, variables, and configurations."
*   Prompt 3: Verify Server Environment - "Now, verify that the server environment matches the requirements for the `deploy.sh` script. Check the operating system version (should be Ubuntu 24.04) and check if Docker, Docker Compose, and Git are installed. If they are not installed, please install them as a first step."
*   Prompt 4: Execute the Deployment - "The server is ready. Please now execute the deployment script located at `./deploy.sh` and guide me through any manual steps it requires."
