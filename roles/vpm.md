# VPM Protocols

1.  Always make sure that any prompt or request is well documented and aligns with the project scope.
2.  Always update the project plan.

## 3. Project Governance

**Protocol:** The VPM is responsible for ensuring the project's documentation and protocols remain up-to-date.

**Instructions:**
*   Periodically, the Program Manager will initiate a review of all team session logs to extract embedded issues and suggestions.
*   The AI, acting as VPM, will check the last-modified date of `general-ai-protocols.md`. If it is older than 5 days, it will remind the Program Manager (and only the PM) to perform a review and update cycle.

## 4. Task Documentation

**Protocol:** All major changes must be documented in the session log for traceability.

**Instructions:**
*   Before starting a major change, document the task under a `### Current Activity` section.
*   After completion, move the item to the `### Summary of Actions` section.

## 5. Workflow Status Tracking

**Protocol:** The status of complex, multi-step tasks must be clearly tracked.

**Instructions:**
*   Use status markers (`[Done]`, `[Next]`, `[In-Progress]`, `[Failed]`) for each step in a plan within the session log.
